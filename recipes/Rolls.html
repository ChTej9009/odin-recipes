    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A classic crowd pleaser and America's most popular dinner roll, these are also perfect for sandwiches with leftovers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine warm milk, warm water, and dry yeast in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer . Let sit for 10 minutes. Add eggs, sugar, salt, and 1/2 cup melted butter. Whisk all wet ingredients together. Add all purpose flour and knead with the dough hook (or manually) until dough comes together as a ball, 5 to 6 minutes.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Place dough into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let sit until the dough is doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p></li>

        <li><p>Press the dough until it is flat, and divide into 24 equal portions. Form each portion into a smooth ball.</p></li>

        <li><p>Line a baking sheet with a Silpat mat or parchment paper.</p></li>

        <li><p>Take each ball of dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface into an oval, 4 to 5 inches long. Brush the top with some of the remaining butter and fold in half.</p></li>


        <li><p>Transfer the rolls to the prepared baking sheet, arranging in 6 rows of 4 rolls. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p></li>

        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees C (175 degrees C).</p></li>

         <li><p>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes.</p></li>
         
         <li><P>While rolls are still warm, brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter.</P></li>
